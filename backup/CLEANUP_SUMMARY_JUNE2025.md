# Stock Analysis Project Cleanup Summary - June 2025

## Files Moved to Backup
- `stock_analysis_results/` directory - Moved to backup as it's been replaced by the improved `analysis_results/` directory
- `demo_analysis.py` - Obsolete demo script
- `main_v2.py` - Superseded by the current main.py
- `panduan_penggunaan.bat` - Redundant with panduan_penggunaan.md documentation
- `demo_transaction_history.csv` - Demo transaction data, moved to backup/transaction_history_backup
- `test_history.csv` - Empty test file, moved to backup/transaction_history_backup

## Documentation Improvements
- Updated `panduan_penggunaan.md` to remove references to obsolete files (demo_analysis.py and panduan_penggunaan.bat)
- Added reference to cek_sistem.py in the usage guide
- Maintained key documentation files:
  - README.md - Main project documentation
  - STATUS_REPORT.md - Application status reports
  - bug_fix_log.md - Bug fix tracking
  - panduan_penggunaan.md - Usage guide (Indonesian)
  - trading_terminology_guide.md - Trading term guide

## Code Fixes
- Fixed references in `cek_sistem.py` that were pointing to the moved stock_analysis_results directory
- Ensured all code references now point to correct directories

## Project Structure Improvements

- Ensured .gitignore properly excludes generated files (*.py[cod])
- Organized analysis results in a dedicated directory structure
- Cleaned up transaction_history folder to contain only active transaction data
